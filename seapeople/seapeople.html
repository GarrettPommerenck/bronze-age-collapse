    <h2>The Sea-Peoples</h2>
    <div id="seapeoples">
    </div>
       <p>
        The mysterious Sea-Peoples were once the worlds accepted scapegoat for the cause of the collapse, mysterious invaders laying waste to coastal towns and provinces, proving a challenge even the might armies of the Pharaoh in Egypt had trouble fighting off.
        While these Sea-Peoples may have hastened the collapse of many coastal nations, they may have been as much a symptom of the collapse rather than a direct cause. Whn faced with economic and social upheaval as well as the collapse of their home society, 
        its not too much a stretch to assume that some may have opted to take up arms and seek fortune elsewhere, turning to piracy and looting in lands that had thus far weathered the collapse. This is one of the many factors contributing the mysterious origins of the Sea-Peoples,
        as more than likely it was never a homogenous group of raiders but rather a diverse, disparate, multicultural diaspora as many peoples turned to raiding and pillaging as society crumbled around them and they too were raided.

        <h3>Origins of the sea Sea-Peoples
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is not a comprehensive list, it merely exists to showcase some of the more notable places and peoples that may have contributed to the Sea-Peoples.

                     As discussed on the Myth and History page, it is very likely that some fragments of the Mycenaean civilization may have joined or became the Sea-Peoples, notable evidence of this is Egyptian accounts of the Denyen(Danaan) and Ekwesh(Achaean) peoples sailing from the north to raid along the Nile river. Both of these names being terms used by the Egyptians and Hittites to refer to the once burgeoning Mycenaean Kingdoms.
                     This is also supported by more physical evidence in the form of Mycenaean pottery throughout the Mediterranean, either remnants of the old trade routes or as Mycenaeans attempting to create a new home in new lands. Building off the later point this was to an extent successful as seen by the Greek speaking population of the Island of Cyprus.

                 <dd>
                    Despite this webpage's heavy focus on the Mediterranean world, it did not exist in a vacuum. Some theorize that some of Sea-Peoples may have been invaders from the Balkan region of central Europe. Pushing in through Greece, across Turkey, and onto the Sea to continue their raiding.

                 <dt><strong>Hittite Survivors</strong></dt>
                 <dd>
                    The Hittite Empire was among the earliest to collapse, due in large part to volatile and hostile relations with the Egyptian and Assyrian nations, both of whom constantly fought and conquered Hittite lands, eventually resulting in Assyria taking the Hittite capital. With the conquest of their capital, the empire left as smoldering embers, and likely raids from the sea, some Hittites may have also joined the Sea-Peoples, turning to raiding to make ends meet and seek a new place in the world.

                 <dd>
                    The Islands of Sicily and Sardinia off the coast of mainland Italy may have been yet another of the Sea-Peoples victims and sources. evidence of Mycenaean pottery has been found on the islands, likely remnants of trade or spoils of war, but more notable is the presence of Nuragic Artifacts and weaponry, suggesting a link to the Sherden People, who were among the Egyptian's named Sea-Peoples groups. It is further theorized that the islands became permanent residences or settlements for the Sherden and Shekelesh peoples, eventually lending their name to the lands.
