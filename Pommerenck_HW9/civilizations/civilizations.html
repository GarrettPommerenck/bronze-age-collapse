       <dt>Minoans</dt>
        <dd>
            The Minoans were a powerful sea-faring civilization residing in Crete, a large island off the coast of mainland Greece.<br>
             As the name suggests this civilization likely serves as the inspiration of the myth of the Minotaur, with remaining ruins on the island consisting of complex palace structures with frequent bull motifs.<br>
             Little is known about the Minoans aside from what references to them were found in other civilizations such as the Myth of the Minotaur, fragments of minoan pottery and scattered references in surviving texts.<br>
             Any surviving records created by the Minoans themselves are unreadable, as they are written in Linear A, a language which disappeared with the Minoans before being replaced later with Mycenaean  Linear B.
        </dd>
       <dt>Mycenaean Greek</dt>
        <dd>
            The Mycenaean Civilization is the last major Greek civilizations before arriving what we would consider Classical Greece, they occupied much of the Greek mainland in fortified cities.
             The Mycenaean Greek were a militaristic society, ruled by warrior-kings who spend much of their wealth on fortifications and wars with other kings.
            Despite what might be suggested by the term "King" the Mycenaean  Kings rules over small sections of land, their walled city and whatever land they could see. This period of time is the most closely associated with Greek Myths, with many events serving as the inspiration for later myths of gods and men.

             </dd>
       <dt>Egyptian Empire</dt>
        <dd>
            The Egyptian Empire of this time, now referred to as the Egyptian New Kingdom, was at the peak of its strength, having recovered lands lost in the past and expanded beyond its prior bounds. This time period included the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II,also known as Ozymandias,
             who is considered one of if not the greatest of Pharaohs for his numerous successful military campaigns and architectural achievements creating monuments all over Egypt that still exist today. 
             Every peak must be followed by a valley, so to came the decline of the New Kingdom, following the death of Ramesses II, his successor Ramses III faced the problems presented by the Bronze Age Collapse, and while he and Egypt as a whole would endure it would be forever changed.
        </dd>
        <dt>Assyrian Empire</dt>
        <dd>
            The Assyrian Empire occupied parts of what is now Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran. The Assyrian Empire in comparison weathered the collapse fairly well, being somewhat insulated from the worst effects by virtue of being an inland empire. The Assyrians did not collapse like many others but did enter a period of stagnation and decline following the death of Ashur-bel-kala.
            Despite a glorious reign curtailing the ambitions of the neighboring Hittites and Babylonians and expanding the the Assyrian Empire into the Levant, his successors were unable to uphold the empire, losing many peripheral territories while struggling to repel Aramean raiders in the Assyrian heartland.
        </dd>
        <dt>Hittite Empire</dt>
        <dd>
            The Hittite Empire occupied much of modern day Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus. The Hittites empire had been in decline for some time, but the bronze age collapse pushed it to the breaking point. Numerous military and territory loses to the neighboring Egyptians and Assyrians forced Hattusili III then king of the empire to seek an alliance with Ramesses II. 
            Offering his daughters hand in marriage in hopes it would end tension with Egypt and stave off the Assyrians who had attempted to conquer both in the past. This gave Hattusili III's successor, Tudhaliya IV enough breathing room to not only save the Hittite heartland from Assyrian invasion but also conquer the nearby Island of Cyprus.
            Unfortunately all this progress and the Hittite Empire as a whole would fall, being pillaged by the Sea-Peoples and conquered by the Assyrians. This was the last Hittite civilization, as the empire was shattered into a number of feuding Syro-Hittite States that all in time fell to the Assyrian Empire.
