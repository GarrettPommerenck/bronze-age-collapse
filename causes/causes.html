    <h2>Potential Causes of the Bronze Age Collapse</h2>
   <p>
    The exact cause of the bronze age collapse is largely unknown, while there a number of theories and explanations for what it could have been, the true cause could have been any combination of them or even something else entirely.
   </p>
    <dl>
       <dt>Natural Disaster</dt>
        <dd>
            Though a somewhat dramatic theory, it a popular and accepted theory that natural disasters of some form had an impact on the civilizations of the time, which contributed to the collapse.
            <h4>Earthquakes</h4>
            <p>
             Notable among the disasters is evidence of an "earthquake storm". While the civilizations of the time may have been accustomed to the occasional earthquake and the rebuilding that would follow, a succession of earthquakes all within a similar time 
             may have prevented civilizations from finishing or even beginning to repair and recover from the damages. While this alone may not have wrought the end of empires, it likely played a contributing factor.
            </p>
             <h4>Volcanos</h4>
             <p>
            Volcanoes may also have played a role, there is evidence of two Volcanic eruptions prior to the time of the collapse that may have impacted the civilizations of the time. The Island of Santorini is still an active volcanic region and ruins on its coast suggest it was once inhabited.
            Much like Pompei, the port city of "Akrotiri" now lies buried ash and volcanic rock. This eruption is theorized to have been a strong contributor to the end of the Minoan civilization and may have had lasting effects on the region.<br>
            </p> 
            <div id="santorini">
            </div>
            <p>
            Another more distant Volcanic eruption may have also played part. The Hekla 3 volcano is Iceland is believed to have erupted around 1159 BC causing food shortage and famine in Egypt and surrounding nations.
            </p>
        </dd>
            
       <dt>Climate Change</dt>
        <dd>
           <p>
            While a Volcanic eruption is undeniably a natural disaster, its aftereffects tend to blur the line into Climate Change which the civilizations of the time were also struggling with.
            There are reports and records of drought and famine across many bronze age civilizations of the time which contributed heavily to stability within and between nations. While civilizations with access to major rivers were able to weather this, such as the Egyptians with the Nile and the Assyrians between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,
             many others were not, potentially leading to miss migrations in search of food and water.
            </p>
             </dd>
             
        <dt>Disease</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
            Few things have the potential capability to bring a society to its knees like a plague. A plague may spread like wildfire even in the best of times, but amidst this turmoil with malnourished and migrant populations it may have been adding pouring gas on the flame.<br>
            There are accounts of pestilence  throughout the the civilized world of the time, leading up to and during the time period of the collapse, with one account from Cyprus stating,<br> “the hand of Nergal is in my country”, with Nergal being the Mesopotamian god of Death and Disease.
            Another notable account is the Plague of the Philistines as described in the Bible in the Book of Samuel.
            </p>
            <blockquote>"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and emerods broke out upon them."<br>
                1 Samuel 5:9</blockquote>
            <p>
            The term emerods is an foreign one in modern parlance and its exact meaning is a subject of debate, with many modern iterations replacing the term with "tumors." Some interpret it instead as pustules, this has led to many suggesting the plague laid upon the Philistines to be an early occurrence of Yersinia Pestis or the bubonic plague.
            Others insist that it may have been other diseases depending on the interpretation and other evidence of the period, some suggesting it to be dysentery, typhoid fever, smallpox, or a similarly lethal disease of the time.
            Regardless of which disease it may have been, it was virulent and lethal, contributing greatly to the instability or even collapse of some nations. 
        </p>
            </dd>
            
        <dt>Political Instability</dt>
        <dd>
        <p> 
            A noticeable trend among the previous potential causes is that they all in some way contribute greatly to political instability in and between nations. Any of these contribute to great stress in a society, which in turn can lead to revolt. 
            Examples of this include the first recorded labor strike during the reign of Ramesses III  after many monument builders and laborers went unpaid, or teh fall of he Canaanite city of Hazor due to lacking food supply.
            This may have lead to a collapse in many smaller, unprepared, or especially unfortunate societies resulting in a diaspora as people search for food and stability elsewhere with many turning to piracy and raiding.
        </p>
        </dd>
            

        <dt>Sea-Peoples</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>
            By far the most famous theorized cause of the collapse are the mysterious Sea-Peoples. A mysterious group of peoples who arrived from the sea, raiding and pillaging islands and coastlines throughout the Mediterranean. For many years the Sea-Peoples were a convenient and accepted scapegoat for the collapse, but many studies show there may be much more at work.<br>
            &emsp;The exact origin of the Sea-Peoples is unknown and a subject of hot debate, some suggesting they came from areas north of the Aegean Sea, from Iberia in modern day Spain, or in more far-flung theories, Scandinavia.<br>
            &emsp;While the authenticity of many of these theories is difficult if not impossible to ascertain, its is undeniable the Sea-Peoples plundered much of the region. What is likely is that the "Sea-Peoples" were exactly that, a collection of peoples from throughout the region that may have turned to raiding and piracy after the fall of their civilization.<br>
