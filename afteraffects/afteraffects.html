    <h2>Aftereffects and Results of the Bronze Age Collapse</h2>
   <p>
    By far the most noticeable aftereffects are those from the collapse itself, the destruction of many empires and civilizations once prosperous. The Minoans, the Hittites, and the Mycenaeans all fell apart, leaving behinds fragments that are still being pieced together.
     While successor states would emerge, not all of them were truly successors, some being overtaken by once rivals and others simply disappearing entirely.<Br>
        <br>
        That having been said, such losses are not the only result of the Collapse. Just as a wildfire primes a land for new growth, so to did the collapse prime the Mediterranean for the nations that followed. The power vacuum left behind by the fall of so many nations allowed the Assyrians to spread further and conquer more lands,
         eventually including the once mighty Egypt within its realm. Though they too would eventually fall, Assyria became a model empire, and an ideal to strive to. One that would not be surpassed until the later Sassanid Empire who would become one of Rome's greatest rivals.
         Similarly after the Greek Dark Age following the collapse, Classical Greece would rise from the Ashes establishing many of todays frameworks in math, culture, and philosophy.
        <br>
        In more material results, the long term disruption of the bronze trade forced many to seek an alternative primary metal, resulting in the discover and widespread use of iron. While iron did exist in worked forms before, bronze was much more easily worked with and typically better than primitive iron. As metallurgy advanced,  more refined iron weaponry and tools proved their effectiveness and reliability over bronze, becoming the dominant metal for nearly 2000 years.
