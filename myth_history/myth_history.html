    <h2>Sifting out History from Myth and Legend </h2>
   <p>
    While many myths and legends contain fantastical and magical elements, many of them are have some foundation in proper history. The difficulty therein often lies in sifting out what kernels of truth lie within the glossy veneer of myth. While a might hero of divine strength might not have actually slayed some sort of many headed serpent, it sis very possible that there was a man that killed a seemingly immortal snake, or at least a great many snakes that looked identical.
    Similar history can be extracted from a number of myths and legends which reference this or prior time periods, which will be discussed shortly.
</p>
    <h3>History from the Myth of the Minotaur</h3>
    <p>
    In the myth of the Minotaur, it is established that every number of years(typically 7 or 9) the city of Athens was required to offer a tribute of 7 young men and 7 young women to the island Nation of Crete to be sacrificed to a man with the head of a bull in a labyrinth. This tribute was payed three times, until a brave Athenian prince volunteered himself as tribute promising to slay the monster and end the cruel tribute.<br>
    &emsp;Applying what we know from real-world archeology we can contextualize much of this to uncover the political relations of the Aegean sea and how the Mycenaeans viewed them. The Minoans inhabited a palace structure which was very complicated for the time, giving rise to the idea of a "labyrinth."
    </p>
    <div id="labyrinth">   
    </div>
    <p>
    In addition much of their iconography has a bull motif, this combined with the fact than Athens, and likely other Greek city-states of the time, were required to give tribute, likely out of fear or respect for Minoan naval might, gave rise to a fear of the "Bull Men" of Minos, or the "Minotaur."
    </p>
    <div id="minoan_bull">
    </div>
    <p>
    Similarly, the actions of the Athenian Prince Theseus may reflect the actions a coalition of Greek mainland city-states led by Athens to "slay the minotaur" by destroying the Minoan Empire.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>History from the Trojan War</h3>
    <p>
    Using the case above as an example we may able to extract similar history from other myths, such as that of the Trojan War. The myth of the Trojan War as made famous in Homer's Iliad describes a war between a number of major Greek city-states and their warrior-kings against the city of Troy due to an agreement binding one another to defend the marriage of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, with whichever king should win her hand.<br>
    &emsp; Later, as part of a deal with the Goddess Aphrodite, Paris, a prince of Troy was promised "The most beautiful woman in the world," who would turn out to be Helen.<br>
    &emsp;As a result upon finding his then wife stolen, Menelaus calls upon the accord agreed to by all major kings to go to war with the bride stealing Paris and by extension Troy, ruled by king Priam, father of Paris.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    This resulted in decade long conflict during which Troy is laid siege and the surrounding lands are pillaged by Greek forces. The Greek are eventually victorious through the cunning of Odysseus, resulting in the sacking and burning of Troy. This victory however is short-lived and pyrrhic, as during the war many Greek kings died, many would struggle to return home, such as Odysseus as described in Homer's Odyssey, and many of those that did return suffered death not long after for one reason or another.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now to apply this to history, we can assume that there was a war between a large number of Mycenaean kings and the city of Troy, eventually resulting in the burning of the city. This much is already reflected in the modern historical records, as the location Troy was said to be occupy contains ruins a city with evidence of a large burn layer at the estimated time of the Trojan war, during or just prior to the time period of the collapse.
     Taking it a bit further with what is known of the Mycenaean civilization, after "burning" much of their wealth on further fortifications or wars amongst each other, a large coalition may have formed seeking to extract wealth from the nearby, wealthy city of Troy in a dire attempt to replenish their rapidly emptying coffers.
    The city of Troy, at the time occupied a prime spot, serving as a major hub if not nexus for trade throughout the Aegean sea, linking the Mycenaean kingdoms to the Hittite Empire, accumulating massive amounts of wealth which it used to defend itself with massive walls. Though the Mycenaeans were successful, many kings died in battle or not long after, resulting in the collapse of Mycenaean Greece as well as the burned Trojan empire.
    </p>
    <p>
    Further applying this to the collapse as a whole, the mere disruption of such a major trade hub would have effects that rippled across trade routes. Its destruction entirely likely destabilized trade for the entire region, further driving many civilizations closer to, if not over, the edge in this already turbulent time period. <br>
    Some of the surviving Mycenaeans, still seeking wealth or simply escape from their collapsing homeland may have turned to raiding, becoming one of the many "Sea-Peoples."
